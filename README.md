# LJIT-lposix
An adaptor from classic PUC-Rio [lposix](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/#lposix) to ljsyscall

Slap lposix.lua anywhere in your LUA_PATH and make sure [ljsyscall](https://github.com/justincormack/ljsyscall) is installed too.

As it turns out, this is mostly a matter of connecting the dots. At least there is (a scarce amount
of) ldoc to look at.
